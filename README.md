# Ransomeware Incident Response

### Analyzing a ransomware attack on a healthcare clinic, focusing on incident documentation, response, and prevention.

RANSOMEWARE ATTACK ON A SMALL HEALTHCARE CLINIC

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project documents a simulated cybersecurity incident at a small U.S. healthcare clinic that provides primary care services. The clinic experienced a ransomware attack that disrupted operations, encrypted critical patient files, and demanded a ransom for their release.
The goal of this project is to explain the incident, how it happened, and what lessons can be learned to prevent similar attacks in the future.

INCIDENT SUMMARY
Date & Time: Tuesday, 9:00 a.m.
Who: An organized group of unethical hackers
What Happened:
- Attackers sent phishing emails to clinic employees.
- These emails contained malicious attachments.
- Once opened, the attachments installed malware that gave the hackers access to the network.
- The hackers deployed ransomware, encrypting important medical records and business files.
- A ransom note demanded a large payment in exchange for the decryption key.
Impact:
- Employees could not access patient records or critical software.
- Business operations came to a complete stop.
- The clinic had to shut down systems and contact authorities and cybersecurity experts.
Why: The attackers were financially motivated.

LESSONS LEARNED
1. Email Security Awareness:
- Employees must be trained to spot phishing attempts.
2. System Protection:
- Install and maintain strong antivirus and anti-malware software.
3. Backup Strategy:
- Keep secure, offline backups of critical files.
4. Incident Response Plan:
- Have a clear step-by-step plan for handling cyber incidents.

OPEN QUESTIONS
- Should the clinic pay the ransom to recover the files?
- What additional security measures can be implemented to avoid future attacks?
